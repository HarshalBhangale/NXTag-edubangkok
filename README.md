# NXTag - Verified Data Collection on EduChain

![NXTag Logo](https://example.com/nxtag-logo.png) <!-- Replace with actual logo URL -->

## Introduction

**NXTag** is a decentralized application (dApp) for verified data collection and rewards, built on **EduChain**. Inspired by a vision to crowdsource high-quality, verified data, NXTag incentivizes user-generated content (UGC) through a social, gamified experience. Imagine a TikTok-like platform, but with a purpose — users contribute valuable, verified data that drives the next generation of AI and educational resources.

NXTag was launched at the **Bangkok Hacker House**, where innovation and decentralization come together. With EduChain, NXTag ensures that data contributors are verified, data is classified, and rewards are earned fairly.

## Features

- **User Verification**: Only verified users can contribute to ensure high-quality data.
- **Data Request Marketplace**: Data consumers can create requests in specific categories, incentivizing user contributions with rewards.
- **Social, Gamified Data Collection**: Users classify and submit data in a reel-like interface, with rewards based on their reputation and verification status.
- **Reward Mechanism**: Verified users earn rewards in Ether (on EduChain) based on their contributions.
- **Decentralized and Transparent**: Built on EduChain to leverage the transparency and security of blockchain technology.

## Why NXTag?

The data ecosystem is growing, but the demand for **high-quality, human-classified data** is reaching a critical point. By 2026, training data for large language models (LLMs) may be exhausted, according to AI experts. NXTag is designed to address this challenge by crowdsourcing verified data through user engagement and incentivization.

NXTag utilizes EduChain’s capabilities to build a decentralized marketplace for data collection that scales globally, while rewarding verified, skilled contributors.
